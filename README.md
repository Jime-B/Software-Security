# Software-Security
Artemis Financial is a consulting firm looking to modernize its operations by improving its software security. In order to secure client date during file transfers via its public web interface, Artemis Financial needed a verification step using checksum to ensure data integrity and authenticity. After reviewing the client’s software security vulnerabilities, it was necessary to implement secure coding protocols like AES encryption, a collision resistant hash function like SHA-256, secure error handling and proper data encoding. This helped increase the layers of security; it is important to protect sensitive financial data and comply with regulatory standard as this will reflect in clients’ trust and the company’s reputation as a reliable and secure entity. 
The challenging part about this project was self-signed certificates because they are functional but showed a warning (“not secure”) in the browsers. 
Secondary and functional testing was conducted after code was refactored to confirm the absence of errors and validate proper integration of new features. Dependency-check reports ensured that all third-party libraries met security standards. Tools such as AES for encryption, SHA-256 for hashing, and structured error handling practices proved invaluable in maintaining data integrity and security. For future tasks, these resources, along with modular design approaches and secure coding practices, will serve as a foundation for strong software development. 
This project showcases expertise in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities, implementing secure protocols, and delivering high-quality, secure solutions—valuable skills that can be demonstrated to future employers through comprehensive testing reports and the effective integration of security features.
